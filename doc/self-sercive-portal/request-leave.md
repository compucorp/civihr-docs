Request leave
==========

Staff can send in requests for leave of different types using the **Request leave** button and filling in details. They can upload files and add notes to support their request. Their designated leave approver will receive an email prompt to act on the request. When the leave approver makes a decision, the staff member who applied for leave will be notified by email. The leave status will be updated in their self-service portal as well.

Weekends are by default excluded from the number of leave days being booked. If someone works on weekends as part of their contract and needs to book time off, they can change the dropdown selection from Excluded to All day or Half day.
