Manage joining, exiting, contract renewals
==========

Adding your organisation’s standard task lists for joining, exiting and contract renewals to CiviHR is a one-time exercise. Now whenever you click on Add Assignment, this standard list will get generated automatically, saving you time and worry about overlooking any task. You can delegate, schedule, add or remove these tasks as required.
