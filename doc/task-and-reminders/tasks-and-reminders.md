Tasks and Reminders
==========

The Tasks Dashboard is the first screen that you see when you login as a CiviHR Administrator. You can create tasks related to joining and exiting, and assign them to your team members or other staff. For example, if your joining workflow includes requesting your IT team to generate a new work email address for the new hire, you can set that up here.
