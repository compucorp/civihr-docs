Customise the user interface
==========

### Change display preferences  

You can pick which fields and tabs should appear when you add a new individual in CiviHR. To do this, go to **Administer > Customise Data and Screens > Display Preferences**. Select the appropriate boxes next to **Editing Contacts:**

For example, if your organisation doesn't collect information on Demographics or Instant Messenger, you could uncheck those boxes and streamline the editing screen. Any information contained in fields you choose not to display remains in your database, and you can choose to display it again at any time by re-checking the boxes in this setting.

### Change terminology using Word Replacement  

CiviHR has a Word Replacement setting that lets you replace existing text with other text. For example, if your organisation prefers to use the term "Employee ID," instead of the term “External ID” that appears in CiviHR, you can define a word replacement and have it automatically altered everywhere on CiviHR.

-  Go to **Administer > Customise Data and Screens > Word Replacements**.
-  Enter the exact word or text you want to replace under the column titled 'Original'. Please note this is case sensitive and requires the same exact spelling of the word or text which you see in CiviHR.
-  On the Replacement column, add the desired phrase that you would like to replace the original word or text with.
-  Check the ‘Exact Match’ and ‘Enabled’ boxes. 
-  You can add additional rows using the Add row button. 
-  Click Save when you are finished entering replacements.

When using this function, be sure to anticipate alternate forms of words and different ways your chosen word or phrase may appear in your CiviHR installation.
