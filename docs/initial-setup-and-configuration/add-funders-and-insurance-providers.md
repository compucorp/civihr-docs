Add funders and insurance providers
==========

You must add health insurance and life insurance providers, and funding organisations or individual donors to CiviHR to be able to select them while adding staff profiles. Although there are many fields available on this page, you can create a new record with just the organisation name. 

-   To add Funding Organisation:  Go to Contacts > New Organization
-   To add Health Insurance Provider: Go to Contacts > New Organization > New Health Insurance Provider.
-   To add Life Insurance Provider:  Go to Contacts > New Organization > New Life Insurance Provider.

To add a new individual donor, Go to **Contacts > New Individual**. Although there are many fields available on this page, you can create a new record with just the first and last name OR an email address.
