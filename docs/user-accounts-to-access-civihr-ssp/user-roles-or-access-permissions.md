User roles or access permissions
==========

User roles allow you to control who can access what information from your CiviHR site. CiviHR has the following built-in roles:

- civihr_staff role: Allows access only to the staff memberâ€™s own Self Service Portal containing their own personal details, leave data, Staff Directory and HR Resources. 
- civihr_manager role: Allows leave approvers to view and respond to leave requests from their team, in addition to their own personal details, leave data, Staff Directory and HR Resources.
- Civihr_admin role: Allows access to all staff data and reports. This permission should be very selectively assigned.
