User roles or access permissions
==========

HR Admins must set up user accounts for staff, to enable them to login to CiviHR. 

User roles allow HR Admins to control who would access what information when they login to their CiviHR site. CiviHR has the following built-in roles:

- civihr_staff role: Allows access only to the staff memberâ€™s own Self Service Portal containing their own personal details, leave data, Staff Directory and HR Resources. 
- civihr_manager role: Allows leave approvers to view and respond to leave requests from their team, in addition to their own personal details, leave data, Staff Directory and HR Resources.
- Civihr_admin role: Allows access to all staff data and reports. This permission should be very selectively assigned.
