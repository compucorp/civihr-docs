Review existing data
==========

Most database applications such as OpenOffice.org Calc, Google Spreadsheets allow exporting data as spreadsheets or CSV files. Look through your staff data in these spreadsheets and mark what you would like to save in CiviHR. 

Try to make as much use of pre-built fields because many of them are linked to additional features. For example, CiviHR has a pre-built field for contract start dates which is linked to headcount and key date reports. If this field is overlooked and a new custom field is created to hold the contract start date, you will not be able to get the most out of the reports feature.

If you have data that cannot be saved in any pre-built CiviHR field, you may need to add custom data fields (see creating custom data fields).
