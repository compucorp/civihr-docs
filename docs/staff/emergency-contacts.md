Emergency Contacts
==========

You can record up to two emergency contacts per staff. Information for these include name, primary email address, two telephone numbers (main phone and main mobile), full address of the emergency contact, relationship with staff, whether your staff has any dependant(s), and a 'Notes' field for additional data. Staff can edit their Emergency Contact information through their Self Service Portal.
