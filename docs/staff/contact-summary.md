Contact Summary
==========

This is the screen you see first when you look up a staff member’s profile. It gives you a summary of that person’s data, including:

-   Contact information, position, contractual place of work, department, manager, personal details, working hours and pay rate
-   Annual leave entitlement and usage
-   Sick leave taken by the staff member: This number is highlighted in red when it becomes more than the the average number of sick days taken by other staff in the organisation.
-   Key dates such as contract start and end
