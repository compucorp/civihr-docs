Staff Profile
==========

Using CiviHR successfully depends on storing data in the right place and in the right way. Contacts are the basic building blocks of CiviHR. Out of the box, CiviHR comes with two contact types:


-   Individuals - such as staff or volunteers
-   Organisations - such as health or life insurance providers and funding agencies


Contacts are organised into tabs, each showing information about different aspects of the contact. Organising data into tabs helps to manage the large amount of information that gets collected over time. 


To add a new staff member, go to **Contacts > New Individual**. Although there are many fields available on this page, you can create a new record with just the first and last name OR an email address. A CiviHR staff profile gets created as soon as you click save. You can click on various tabs of the staff profile to add related information.
