My Sickness
==========

Report sickness
------------------------

Staff can report days taken off due to sickness from their self-service portal. They can add documents - such as a doctorâ€™s letter -  and notes to support their report. Their designated leave approver will receive an email prompt to approve or reject the report. When the leave approver makes a decision, the staff member who reported sickness will be notified by email. The sickness report status will be updated in their self-service portal as well.
